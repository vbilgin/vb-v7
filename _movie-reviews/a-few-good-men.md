*Directed by Rob Reiner*

Well, I finally watched this after hearing about it for years. It was really good! Sorkin's dialogue is witty and crisp as usual. It was fun to see Tom Cruise play an unlikable character for the first third of the film (I assume he's played others but I've only seen him play likable ones). And Jack Nicholson plays an angry guy perfectly... who could've thought?

I don't know why I'm not giving this film a 5/5. Something about it just kept it from that score and I can't seem to express it in words. I had fun, though, so I'm not going to think about it all that hard.
