_Directed by Greg Kohs_

I think all I need to say is that after I finished this documentary, I decided to learn how to play Go.

What a ride this film was. It really felt like I was watching a well-crafted drama when AlphaGo was playing against Lee Sedol. What a strange feeling to be hopeful for both a man and a machine. I wonder if this is how the public felt while watching Garry Kasparov play against Deep Blue.
