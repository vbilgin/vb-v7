*Directed by Wes Anderson*

This is the most beautifully animated stop motion film I’ve seen. To be fair I haven’t seen that many but this film has made me want to watch more of them just to compare. Seriously, I sometimes had to tell myself to actually listen to the dialogue since I kept wondering how in the hell they managed to get these characters to move the way they did. Everything is so fluid yet also unmistakably stop motion. And the colors... wow. Vibrant is downplaying it. Overall, from a visual perspective this film gets a 5 out of 5.

The characters are great and their arcs feel relatable. I love how Anderson manages to work with and around the fact that we’re watching animals. Their traits define their characters but the way they act (besides the obvious) is so human. I was actually taken aback by some of the lines in this. At one point Fox’s wife says she loves him but shouldn’t have married him. God damn. I wanted to hug him. And these are animated foxes, people. Meanwhile there are living actors in some films that I don’t care half as much about.

I think this film does start to drag a little bit toward the third act. It‘s really not a big deal but I mention it only because everything else is pretty much flawless.

If you’re a fan of Wes Anderson, stop motion, or just want to watch a great film, this is for you.
