_Directed by Rob Savage_

There were two good things about this film:

1. The acting
2. The credits

I don't mean the latter to be snide. The credits were actually pretty creative. That's where the creativity stopped, though. [Unfriended](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3713166) went with almost this exact same premise in 2014 (with Skype, hah). And the jumpscares could be seen from a mile away.

If you're looking for a decent (and short!) horror flick then this might be worth a watch. Otherwise feel free to skip it.
