_Directed by Shaka King_

I’m not sure if I’m just paying more attention now but I feel like a lot more great films about 20th century civil rights struggles are coming out. This film is no exception. It’s well-directed, well-acted, and informative. LaKeith Stanfield does a particularly great job as Bill.
