_Directed by Zack Snyder_

Goddamn this was awesome! Many orders of magnitude better than the original cut. I actually never finished the original cut because of how uninteresting it was. Everything is better this time around. There’s an actual villain instead of a cardboard cutout of one. The heroes feel like they have chemistry. No terrible jokes. And no more CGI upper lip!!

Yes it’s 4 hours long but I haven’t been this excited when watching a superhero movie since 2012’s *The Avengers*.
