_Directed by Lee Isaac Chung_

A beautiful film about... if I'm being honest I don't really know what this film was about. A part of me wants to say family but that feels incomplete - like I'm doing a diservice to Chung. Regardless, I really enjoyed the acting and music but the story itself seemed to taper off in quality towards the end. Unfortunate considering how strong the rest of the film was. The child actors were pretty good as well and thatâ€™s always nice to see.
