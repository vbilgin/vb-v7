_Directed by John Madden_

First this and then Molly's Game. Chastain does play the role of a strong and ruthless women well. I was actually enjoying this movie until the last third. Then it just kind of devolved into a completely unrealistic mess full of gotchas. I assume most of the film wasn't realistic (I'm not a lobbyist in Washington so I can't say for sure) but I really wish things didn't get so blatantly dumb.
