*Directed by Aaron Sorkin*

Snappy dialogue and good performances from the cast hold this film up. And the story, of course. Besides those elements, this film falls short or is just "eh."

A fun watch but don't go into it expecting Sorkin to be an expert director. It's his directorial debut and it shows. Thankfully he has evolved his style and his most recent film, [The Trial of the Chicago 7](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1070874), was much better.
