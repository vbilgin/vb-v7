_Directed by Regina King_

I enjoyed this film. It was competent and well-acted. The standout was definitely the acting. Everything else was fine but not really noteworthy. And that's fine. I think the film does what it set out to do: give us an interesting and enlightening conversation between some larger-than-life figures of the time. I recommend this film if you're interested in the civil rights movement or any of the men the film depicts.
