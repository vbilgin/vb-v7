*Directed by Aneesh Chaganty*

This was a fun film! I enjoyed the performances and the tone it set. Sarah Paulson does a great job as always and Kiera Allen is great in her role as Chloe. I thought I recognized Allen from another film so I looked at her IMDb and found that this was the first feature film she's been in. Pretty damn good performance considering it's her first. I'm excited to see what she does next.

Overall, this film is competently directed and succeeds in doing what a thriller should do: get your heart pumping. The twist is pretty obvious so I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who likes being completely smacked in the face by some "Aha!" moment at the end. Speaking of the ending, the final scene in the film should've been cut. It makes little to no sense and I think the only reason it's there is to leave off with something dramatic or sinister. But why? It feels pointless.

Watch this film if you like thrillers but don't expect a mystery that you can't unravel yourself.
