*Directed by Pete Docter*

I really liked this. It was funny, looked amazing, and the sound design was great (especially when it came to the jazz; I’m listening the soundtrack as I type this). The story was the only part that sort of lacked substance in my opinion. The “Great Before” along with the counselors and accountant was inventive but almost everything concerning Joe and 22 was a bit cliche. The down on his luck musician who thinks playing in the right place and the right time will completely change his life. The naive girl who thinks she’s experienced everything but really knows nothing about living. That’s not to say I didn’t like and identify with these characters — I did. But I didn’t really have much of an “Aha!” moment at the end when Joe did. The “answer” felt too simplistic. Though I did like the realization that someone's spark isn't the same as their purpose.

Anyway, this is a fun film that kids will like and their parents will get a kick out of too. That’s most Pixar films so if you liked the earlier ones, you’ll like this one.
