*Directed by Darius Marder*

Absolutely incredible. From the loud, thrashing opening to the haunting end. The performances in this film are next-level. Sometimes I get taken out of a film because I literally can't understand how a person can act so well when they have a large camera pointed at their face. Riz Ahmed's performance made me do that multiple times. But I was immediately drawn back in. Olivia Cooke and Paul Raci did amazing jobs as well. I got close to these characters; felt their emotions plain as day. The last scene with Ahmed and Raci in particular left me feeling so profoundly sad for both characters.

And how could I not mention the sound design? It does such a good job of pulling you into Ruben's new world. It's almost as disconcerting for us as it is for him. An already great film was made even better with these additions.

Watch this as soon as you can.
