*Directed by Christopher Nolan*

Let's get the obvious stuff out of the way:
1. The visuals were great
2. The performances were great

Cool, now I can say this: I had no idea what was happening for a majority of this film. I can forgive (and even welcome) some confusion in a film's plot. Take Menento (also directed by Nolan) for example. That film is confusing and it's meant to be because it serves the plot. The film is better off for it. Tenet, in my opinion, is not better off for being confusing. I'm sorry, but if your audience can't understand basic plot points because the overarching premise behind those plot points wasn't explained well then that's on you.

Also, some of the fight scenes were so damn choppy.
