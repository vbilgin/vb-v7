*Directed by Rob Reiner*

Seems I'm on a bit of a 90s Rob Reiner/Aaron Sorkin kick, huh? I enjoyed this film quite a bit! What a stark contrast to our current political situation. It made me laugh more than I thought it would. I do have to say that this movie is really cheesy sometimes, though. Like *really* cheesy. Sorkin's dialogue is witty as always but my god, that final speech by President Shepard is ridiculous. I don't know, maybe people in the 90s actually felt that their politicians could muster something like that.

Anyway, I had a fun time with this and would recommend it as a lazy weekend watch to take your mind off the world.
