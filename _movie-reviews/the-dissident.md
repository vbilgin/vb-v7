_Directed by Bryan Fogel_

The subject matter of this documentary is so important to explore. And the things we're shown are both terrifying and extremely saddening. What's more is that we probably won't ever see true justice for Jamal Khashoggi.

The film does a good job of capturing raw emotion and weaving a cohesive narrative but I have a few problems with it:

1. The visualizations used in this film are often clich√© and sometimes downright laughable
2. Its pacing in the first half could use some serious work. I turned this film off at around the 30 minute mark because I found myself getting bored and the rest of the first half felt like a slog. The second half made up for it, though.

Other than those few complaints, I thought this was a very competent documentary and I would recommend that anyone unfamiliar with Khashoggi watch it.

Also, as a side note, I was annoyed but not surprised at how the major streaming platforms outright refused to offer this film for fear of MBS and the Saudi royal family. Shameful.
