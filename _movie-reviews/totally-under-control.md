*Directed by Alex Gibney, Ophelia Harutyunyan, and Suzanne Hillinger*

I don't care what side of the aisle you're on, it's pretty clear that the US government did a terrible job handling this year's pandemic. To call the federal response effort lackluster is an understatement. This documentary puts a bright spotlight on the people responsible. It also provides a voice for the people who tried (and sometimes succeeded) in doing the right things. The film was well shot, well narrated, and had good visuals. The one thing I wish it had was more people that might've defended the Trump administration. Not because I believe that administration deserved it, but because I wanted the interviewers to challenge these people (not attack but question) on their beliefs. I was particularly disappointed with the "interview" of Dr. Zev Zelenko. Maybe footage was cut, I don't know. What I do know is that I wanted to hear his justification for pushing a remedy that had no basis in research for working. And then I wanted that justification to be challenged if it wasn't good enough.

This was a great documentary and I'm sure more good reporting will come after we put this pandemic behind us. I just wish this film did more to probe into why the people at the top did what they did and why regular people went along with it.
