It's almost the end of the year and I'm hustling to get classes done for school. If I want to graduate by mid-2021 then I have to finish 6 classes plus a written capstone project in 6 months. I'm worred but also excited to (hopefully) be done soon.

Besides that, I'm trying to keep up my habits and form new ones. This has always been a struggle for me. I've made decent progress in the past few weeks but I'm still not where I want to be.

Work is work. I'm hoping that after I finish school I'll have more time to really dig into my blindspots at work (namely networking).
