This page lists some of my projects. A project could be an experiment, a new habit I want to build, or just me messing around with something cool and documenting the results.

## [Books](/projects/books)
*This project is ongoing (and will hopefully stay that way for the rest of my life.)* 

Here is a where I document the book(s) I'm currently reading, books I've read, and books that I want to read. The finished books typically have a link to my review. Some books are marked as "DNF" meaning I started but did not finish them.

## [Spending](/projects/spending)
*This project is ongoing.*

In this project I try to document every cent I spend in order to get a better understanding of where my money goes and why. The reason behind doing it publicly is simple: knowing that someone could see my embarassing extravagent purchase keeps me from making it.
