This page lists some of my projects. A project could be an experiment, a new habit I want to build, or just me messing around with something cool and documenting the results.

- [`./books`](/projects/books) --
*This project is ongoing.* Here is where I document the book(s) I'm currently reading and those I've read in the past. The finished ones typically have a link to my review.

- [`./movies`](/projects/movies) --
*This project is ongoing.* Movie watching log and reviews.

- [`./spending`](/projects/spending) --
*This project is ongoing.* In this project I try to document every cent I spend in order to get a better understanding of where my money goes and why. The reason behind doing it publicly is simple: knowing that someone could see my embarassing or extravagent purchase keeps me from making it.

- [`./poems`](/projects/poems) --
*This project is ongoing.* Some original poems I've written. I'll add to this project as I write more of them.

- [`./fav-album-covers`](/projects/fav-album-covers) --
*This project is ongoing.* I've recently started grabbing high-res versions of album covers that I think are cool. Kind of like book covers, I think that good album covers really add to the experience of listening to an album or even a song. Plus they help provide a visual attachment for the auditory sensations of the music.
