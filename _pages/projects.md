This page lists some of my projects. A project could be an experiment, a new habit I want to build, or just me messing around with something cool and documenting the results.

## Ongoing

- [`./books`](/projects/books) --
  Reading log and book reviews.

- [`./movies`](/projects/movies) --
  Movie watching log and reviews.

- [`./poems`](/projects/poems) --
  Some poems I've written. I'll add to this project as I write more of them.

- [`./fav-album-covers`](/projects/fav-album-covers) --
  I've recently started grabbing high-res versions of album covers that I think are cool. Kind of like book covers, I think that good album covers really add to the experience of listening to an album or even a song. Plus they help provide a visual attachment for the auditory sensations of the music.

## Completed

- [`./spending`](/projects/spending) --
  In this project I tried to document every cent I spend in order to get a better understanding of where my money went and why. It went on for two months and I gained some needed insights. I'm looking into a more automated and interactive project in this same vein.
