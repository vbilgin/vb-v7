This page lists some of my projects. A project could be an experiment, a new habit I want to build, or just me messing around with something cool and documenting the results.

## [Books](/projects/books)
*This project is ongoing (and will hopefully stay that way for the rest of my life.)*

Here is a where I document the book(s) I'm currently reading, books I've read, and books that I want to read. The finished books typically have a link to my review.

## [Movies](/projects/movies)
*This project is ongoing.*

Movie watching log and reviews.

## [Spending](/projects/spending)
*This project is ongoing.*

In this project I try to document every cent I spend in order to get a better understanding of where my money goes and why. The reason behind doing it publicly is simple: knowing that someone could see my embarassing or extravagent purchase keeps me from making it.

## [Poems](/projects/poems)
*This project is ongoing.*

Some original poems I've written. I'll add to this project as I write more of them.
