- Pick up your brush,
- Paint what you see.
- Then pull back
- And peer closely.

- Now hang it up
- Among the rest –
- Stare at it: wide-eyed.
- You’ve painted life.

- Not yours as it is
- But what it could be;
- In some foreign land,
- No fear at all,
- A fuller life.

- You throw down brush,
- Throw them all –
- The tools you know –
- Because you see too much.

- Now ease back
- And exclaim, “Why!
- The strokes I see
- Are so far from mine!”

- Or maybe they are
- Even your own, or
- A changing man’s –
- Same face and name
- Yet different soul.
