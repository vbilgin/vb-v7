- soft touch,
- cool air:
- a breeze is flowing
- through us
- as we
- sit and talk about nothing.
- do you feel it?
- that familiar twist?
- the same thought
- i had
- when we met.
- i saw violet shades
- and holy hands.
- you told me
- too many people
- want to be happy.
- well,
- i just want
- to be.
