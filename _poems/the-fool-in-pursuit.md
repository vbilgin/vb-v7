- Hairs out of the shadow
- Dot the land and shape the sight.
- I barrel forward, sharp-eyed,
- Toward the thicket,
- Down into depths known by others
- But not by me, undeserving.
- Faced with pressure to pursue
- That fabled land, charming blue,
- Bleeding brown to crumbled grey.
- I know little of the land I seek
- Though I seek little of it in the end.
- But now is only the beginning
- So I face the harsh night,
- The same harsh day,
- The Fight --
- And seek it still. Such a fool am I --
- Unburndened.
