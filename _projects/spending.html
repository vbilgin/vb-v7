<em>This project is complete.</em>
<p>
  In this project I tried to document every cent I spend in order to get a
  better understanding of where my money went and why. It went on for two months
  and I gained some needed insights. I'm looking into a more automated and
  interactive project in this same vein.

<table class="spending__table">
  <tr>
    <th>Date</th>
    <th>Item</th>
    <th>Amount (USD)</th>
  </tr>
  {% for purchase in site.data.spending reversed %}
  <tr>
    <td>{{ purchase.date | date: '%m/%d/%Y' }}</td>
    <td>{{ purchase.name }}</td>
    <td class="spending__amt">{{ purchase.amount }}</td>
  </tr>
  {% endfor %}
